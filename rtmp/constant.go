/**
* 6.1.2. Chunk Message Header
* There are four different formats for the chunk message header,
* selected by the "fmt" field in the chunk basic header.
*/
// 6.1.2.1. Type 0
// Chunks of Type 0 are 11 bytes long. This type MUST be used at the
// start of a chunk stream, and whenever the stream timestamp goes
// backward (e.g., because of a backward seek).
const RTMP_FMT_TYPE0 = 0
// 6.1.2.2. Type 1
// Chunks of Type 1 are 7 bytes long. The message stream ID is not
// included; this chunk takes the same stream ID as the preceding chunk.
// Streams with variable-sized messages (for example, many video
// formats) SHOULD use this format for the first chunk of each new
// message after the first.
const RTMP_FMT_TYPE1 =  1
// 6.1.2.3. Type 2
// Chunks of Type 2 are 3 bytes long. Neither the stream ID nor the
// message length is included; this chunk has the same stream ID and
// message length as the preceding chunk. Streams with constant-sized
// messages (for example, some audio and data formats) SHOULD use this
// format for the first chunk of each message after the first.
const RTMP_FMT_TYPE2 = 2
// 6.1.2.4. Type 3
// Chunks of Type 3 have no header. Stream ID, message length and
// timestamp delta are not present; chunks of this type take values from
// the preceding chunk. When a single message is split into chunks, all
// chunks of a message except the first one, SHOULD use this type. Refer
// to example 2 in section 6.2.2. Stream consisting of messages of
// exactly the same size, stream ID and spacing in time SHOULD use this
// type for all chunks after chunk of Type 2. Refer to example 1 in
// section 6.2.1. If the delta between the first message and the second
// message is same as the time stamp of first message, then chunk of
// type 3 would immediately follow the chunk of type 0 as there is no
// need for a chunk of type 2 to register the delta. If Type 3 chunk
// follows a Type 0 chunk, then timestamp delta for this Type 3 chunk is
// the same as the timestamp of Type 0 chunk.
const RTMP_FMT_TYPE3 = 3

/**
* 6. Chunking
* The chunk size is configurable. It can be set using a control
* message(Set Chunk Size) as described in section 7.1. The maximum
* chunk size can be 65536 bytes and minimum 128 bytes. Larger values
* reduce CPU usage, but also commit to larger writes that can delay
* other content on lower bandwidth connections. Smaller chunks are not
* good for high-bit rate streaming. Chunk size is maintained
* independently for each direction.

/**
* 6.1. Chunk Format
* Extended timestamp: 0 or 4 bytes
* This field MUST be sent when the normal timsestamp is set to
* 0xffffff, it MUST NOT be sent if the normal timestamp is set to
* anything else. So for values less than 0xffffff the normal
* timestamp field SHOULD be used in which case the extended timestamp
* MUST NOT be present. For values greater than or equal to 0xffffff
* the normal timestamp field MUST NOT be used and MUST be set to
* 0xffffff and the extended timestamp MUST be sent.
